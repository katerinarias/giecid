**Resumen**: This article examines how colonial legacies shape parents' schooling experiences in multilevel schools within the Mapuche context of La Araucanía, Chile, also known as WallMapu. Authorities built schools to evangelize Indigenous people into Christianity. Researchers used biographical narratives to reflect the importance of orality for the Mapuche. The findings show that the physical and psychological violence endured by Mapuche children has widened the educational gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations. The study concludes that recognizing the harm caused by the school system is essential to rebuild trust and improve educational outcomes for Indigenous children.
