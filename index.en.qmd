## About Us

The Research Group on Education in Indigenous and Diverse Contexts (GIECID) is composed of academics and researchers with a solid trajectory in the study of education in intercultural, indigenous and socio-cultural diversity contexts. The group aims to generate critical, situated and relevant knowledge that contributes to educational transformation from a social justice perspective, recognizing and valuing the knowledge, languages and epistemologies of indigenous peoples.

GIECID promotes a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach, based on the articulation between university, communities and territories, in order to contribute to the development of pedagogical policies, practices and knowledge that strengthen educational processes in indigenous and diverse contexts.
